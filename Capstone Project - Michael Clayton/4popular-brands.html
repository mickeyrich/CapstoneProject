				<h3>Scion</h3>
				<aside>
					<h3>Scion Testimonial</h3>
					<p><i>"Scion, with its stylish and sporty compact vehicles and innovative pricing strategies, captured the hearts of younger consumers, showcasing a unique approach to automotive design and marketing."</i></p>
				</aside>
				<p>Scion, launched by Toyota in 2003, aimed to attract younger customers with stylish, sport compact vehicles and a unique "pure price" sales model. The brand emphasized distinctive design and personalization options through dealer-installed accessories. Despite initial success and innovative marketing strategies targeting millennials, Scion struggled post-2007 financial crisis due to unsustainable product cycles and pricing strategies. In 2016, Toyota announced Scion's discontinuation, with some models rebranded under Toyota. Scion's approach to marketing and its focus on a youthful demographic were notable in the automotive industry.</p>
